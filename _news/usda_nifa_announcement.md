I'm pleased to announce in August I'll start as USDA NIFA PostDoc Fellowship in the [Plant Computational Genomics Lab](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=uconn+plant+computation+genomics+lab&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) with Dr. Jill Wegrzyn. The grant is focused on creating a new reference genome for the eastern hemlock and identifying climate adaptive genomic variation that is at risk of extirpation. The advisory committee is a great set of scientists, including Dr. Steve Keller, Dr. Dana Nelson, and Dr. Rachel Kappler. Looing forward to some field work in some beautiful East coast forests!
